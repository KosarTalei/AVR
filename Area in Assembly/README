The function named AreaA in area.asm, receives the number of vertices and an array of the vertex
coordinates and returns the final result and a “Makefile” to build the project.
The file “main.c” uses a function called AreaC to calculate the area on its
own. 

In two versions:
A 32-bit version using the floating-point coprocessor (x87)
instructions.
A 64-bit version using the SSE or AVX SIMD instructions.
